Check out the current Photon/Core Particle firmware (current version 0.4.3)

git clone -b photon_043 https://github.com/spark/firmware.git

Next, copy the build helper scripts from the build directory into
the checked out firmware/main directory:

copy build/* [git-checkout-dir]/firmware/main

Adjust the precompiler settings in src/application.h if needed.

Build photon or core firmwares using the build scripts in main:

cd [git-checkout-dir]/firmware/main
. fridget_photon.sh
or
. fridget_core.sh
respectively.

If core or photon is connected via USB and in DFU flash mode, the
firmware is automatically flashed after the build is complete.

The *.bin files for flashing via cloud are created in the src/target
folder of the fridget sandbox.
